# node-socket

## Start the application:
- Open a terminal and run the following command to start your application:
```
    npm install 
    node server.js
```
- Navigate to http://localhost:3000 and observe your browser's console and your server's terminal for messages.
 This is a simple example. In real-world applications, you'd handle more complex scenarios, send different event types, handle reconnections, and potentially deal     with scalability concerns. Socket.io is powerful and has more features that allow more advanced use cases. Always refer to the [official documentation ](https://socket.io/docs/v4) for deeper insights and details.

- When a user clicks "Join Room 1" or "Join Room 2", they'll join the corresponding chat room and send a greeting message to everyone in that room.

This is a basic example. In a real-world application:

* You'd likely have a UI for displaying messages in the chat room.
* You might include features to see who is in each room.
* You would handle leaving rooms.
* You'd need better error handling and potentially security features, like authentication and moderation.

But the essence is that **socket.join()** lets you manage rooms on the server side, and **io.to(room).emit()** lets you send messages to specific rooms.
